# TrueFaceAI

SIH Project

## Getting Started

TrueFaceAI is a deep fake detection app that identifies face-swap manipulations in videos. Powered by PyTorch (ResNet-18 + LSTM), it provides frame-by-frame analysis, highlights abnormalities, and generates detailed reports. Built with Flutter (mobile), React (web), and Django (API), it offers real-time detection and visualization.
